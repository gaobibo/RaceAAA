# RaceAAA
RaceAAA is a race/event management system. In the project, JavaScript and bootstrap4 were used for client-side programming; On the server-side, we used flask-sqlalchemy and mysql-connector-python for database programming. In both runner and event search, in order to avoid the SQL injection and implement a Google-like searching, we use Python Regular Expression API to split userâ€™s input content to alphabet and number only words, and use SQL Regular Expression operator with the predefined pattern to find out the matching records.
